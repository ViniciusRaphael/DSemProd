# Forecasting Rossmann Store Sales 

Welcome to our project! Here at DSemProd, we have developed a system that predicts the sales of Rossmann Store for the upcoming six weeks. 

Rossmann is a well-known chain of cosmetics stores in Europe. To streamline their business strategy, they need accurate sales forecasts. That's where we stepped in. We applied Machine Learning techniques to their historical sales data, which involved 1,115 Rossmann stores to provide them with accurate prediction models. 

Not too familiar with Machine Learning? No problem. Think of it as teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make educated predictions based on those patterns. In our case, these patterns come from previous sales data.

Now, let's take a tour of our project repository!

## Project Contents

Our project repository broadly contains sales forecasting model, data sets and relevant code scripts.

1. Our **Sales Forecasting Model** - This is where our magic happens! We train our model with the help of Rossmann's historical data. It then predicts future sales trends.

2. **Data Sets** - Here you will find the actual sales data of 1,115 Rossmann stores. This data is crucial in training our sales forecasting model.

3. **Code Scripts** - Our coding scripts are essentially the building blocks of this project. They help manipulate data, train our model, and execute predictions. These scripts are written in Python.
